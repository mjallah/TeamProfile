# TeamProfile
For this project we were asked to create a team profile generator. Basically the user would be allowed to make his/her team given the options of being a manager, engineer or intern. Once the user is finished, they can click the none option and a html will be created showing their newly made team.

To start, I was given incomplete test files of a Manager, Engineer, and Intern, and created javascript files that were able to run these tests without error.

After I was able to run the tests without error, I started on my app.js Using Inquirer prompt, I was able to run these tests and allow questions to be asked to the user. In doing so, I used recursion to allow the questions to be repeated until the user is done with their team in which they would click none.

Once none was chosen, I was able to tie my app.js with my html renderer, thus creating an html displaying the users team.
